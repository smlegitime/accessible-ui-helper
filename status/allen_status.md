11.4: Completed the implementation and testing of exportManager (but after discussions with the team, it was decided that this functionality would be implemented by the frontend, so the code was moved to backend/archive).

11.22: Completed the first version of fixedPageEvaluator and related tests, and added relevant data processing logic in controllers.

11.26: Completed the first version of outputTransformer and related tests, and added relevant data processing logic in controllers.

12.1: Updated the latest version of outputTransformer and improved the prompt for the LLM to ensure more stable outputs, while ensuring the backend process flows smoothly. Fixed the bug that prevented violations in CSS files from being resolved.
